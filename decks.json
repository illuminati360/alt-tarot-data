A lone night for ancient Celts to pay homage to their ancestors. Much like the Dia de Los Muertos (Day of the Dead) celebrated in Mexico a few days later, a day for modern pagans to welcome back the cherished souls of their loved ones, who have gone before them.   \nAnd finally, The night of All Hallows Eve represents the chilling darkness, the eerie glowing lights from carved Jack O' Lanterns on the porches of the suburban houses. \n"

With my cards, if someone is angry, sad or happy, you'll see their face contort with this emotion, just like a real person's face does when they're feeling that way.

A donkey is on the top of the wheel braying with a motto that says in Italian: \"I will reign.\" A young man descending the wheel has the motto appears self-aware that he is losing his reign while the old man laying at the bottom of the wheel has clearly lost his kingdom.\n"

With my cards, if someone is angry, sad or happy, you'll see their face contort with this emotion, just like a real person's face does when they're feeling that way.

    "description": "Tarot card illustrations \u00a9 Lo Scarabeo\nChillingly wrought in exquisite and realistic detail The Vampires Tarot of the Eternal Night\n is ideal for exploring your dark side. Do you dare to venture forth into a world where time is meaningless, light is death, love is cold, and power rules? \nEvoking a sublime mixture of horror and pity, these tragic, ageless beings tell a fascinating story. With eternity before them they must find a way to survive a nightmare of contradictions. What they offer is a rare form of wisdom that perhaps only the damned can impart.\nThe tarot cards depict a rich  world of darkness inhabited by undead vampires whose dramatic presence and subtly horrific demeanor effectively portray a secret world bathed in moonlight, ancient memories and casual horror. \nThe inverse nature of the deck creates unusual twists such as \nthe Sun portrayed as purifying fire burning away the corruption that is vampire existence.\nA tall brooding stranger gazes knowingly over a balustrade, while The Hermit card's lantern is cleverly depicted as a streetlight. The deck is artistic and it's figures are expressive. Fans of Twilight would find this stunning deck a sanguine addition to their tarot collection.\n"

    "description": "The Via Tarot: The Path of Life\nbegan as a visionary dream, and through a series of scryings, images for the Major trumps were received from entities identified by the artist as the Daughters of Light and the Daughters of the Daughters of Light.\nThe images channeled to Susan Jameson were at first seen as small bubbles of light, which would slowly grow over time as the full image of a given card was revealed. \nIncluded at the top of the minor arcana cards is a circular inset contaning additional imagery which was intended to be included in Aleister Crowley's Thoth deck as he initially designed it, but were inexplicably left out by the painter despite his intentions.\nThus, the Via Tarot can be considered a tribute to Crowley. \nThe Devil card shows an elongated, sun-bleached goat skull attached to a column rising from the ground with bones scattered about in the foreground. The skull has a single cyclops eye in addition to its' two empty sockets. The twisting horns rise up to the upper corners of the picture and within this triangular area is a blazing sun. The effect here reflects the tremendous will to life that we possess, even in the most challenging or frightening circumstances. \n"

    "description": "The concept for the Vikings Tarot\n is from Manfredi Toraldo, who also created the Olympus Tarot and Durer Tarot while the artwork is by Sergio Tisselli.\nThis theme deck depicts Scandinavian raiders who invaded and settled parts of Europe, Britain, and even North America in the ninth to eleventh centuries. \nThey have a reputation for being barbarians, heroic and bloodthirsty warriors, but they also had a complex and diverse culture that included merchants, craftsmen, traders and farmers.\nTwo distinct groups of gods in Norse mythology are represented.\nThe Aesir are the supreme gods, like Loki, Frigg, Thor and Odin, and have been associated with the major arcana. \n The Vanir are the indigenous gods of agriculture and domestic life, and they have been linked with the suit of Chalices (Cups).\nWands are represented by Giants, Pentacles by stocky, hairy Dwarves and blue-skinned, pointy-eared Elves. Men, as instruments of destiny represent the Swords suit.\nThe Queen of Chalices is pink-clad with a diadem on her brow, and a large chalice cradled in both hands. She sits on the snowy shores of a reflective lake, and above her the sky blazes with a thousand stars.\n"

In this Native American tarot deck it is\nThe Hanged Man, referred to as Vision Quest, who is the focal point.\nThe cards feature beautiful wild landscapes with big striped skies and brilliant sunsets, mountains and rivers. \nFor readers who enjoy animal symbols, you will be pleased that Vision Quest Tarot\nis howling, growling and hooting at you:\na host of birds, reptiles, animals, minerals and vegetables are featured in the cards. \nEach of the Minor Arcana have a word of interpretation on it and many of these are enlightening.\n"

    "name": "yeager_meditation",
    "description": "The Yeager Tarot of Meditation\nwas originally published in 1975 by the artist Marty Yeager and Ken Hickenbottom as simply \ufffdThe Tarot.\ufffd\nThe male Court cards look like they are moonlighting at a strip joint when not busy posing for tarot portraits: The Pages wear only headbands, briefs and boots.  The Knights wear only briefs, and the Kings are attired in just briefs and sandals.\nThe thrones of the Kings and Queens and the headbands of the Pages bear strange words which on close inspection turn out to be anagrams.  For the King of Cups the word is \ufffdFEEIL\ufffd (I feel), the Queen of Swords is \ufffdLYZEIANA\ufffd (I analyze), and the Page of Wands is \ufffdSIEE\ufffd (I see). \nThe Minors are set against starry outer-space vistas, with different background colors for each suit:  Swords are dark blue, Cups are light blue, Wands are maroon, and Pentacles are orangey-red. \nThere are no pictorial scenes on the numbered pip cards. Since Yeager specifically intended his deck to be used for meditation, perhaps he felt that no one would be using the Minors much.\n"

    "description": "The Zigeuner Gypsy Tarot\nis also known as the Gipsy Tarot Tsigane.  Artist Walter Wegmuller displays a whimsical art style with bright colors and non-traditional symbols.\nPeople are given triangular faces dominated by large, heavily lashed eyes. The scenes of the major arcana and court cards are highly detailed and use bright, jewel-like colors. The numbered minor arcana are more basic pips, but even they are highly detailed and extremely colorful.\nIt would be accurate to describe this deck as psychedelic. Be careful with that Axe, Eugene!\n"

    "description": "The Zombie Tarot: An Oracle of the Undead \nis an enjoyable tarot deck worth reading with during Halloween season or anytime you feel zombies might convey the best message for what's on your mind even if you aren't a big fan of the Walking Dead.\nThe suits of the minor arcana remain traditional except pentacles/coins are represented by biohazard symbols referred to as \"hazards\". \nThe quirky illustrations by Paul Kepple (Housewives\ufffd Tarot) are more humorous than scary despite the abundance of gore.\nThey conjure a feeling of nostalgia as if this is from a 50s or 60s horror movie. It would be fair to describe this deck as the Housewives Tarot invaded by a Zombie Apocalypse.\nThe 5 of Wands depicts a man lying on the floor, covered in blood and trying to crawl away despite the fact that both of his legs have been hacked off at the knees. \nAbove him two zombies are fighting over an amputated drumstick. The meaning: Quarrels, Strife, and Competition. I find that these cards have dual meanings depending on whether you focus on the humans or the zombies.\nFor instance this card could also mean determination despite handicap (or injury).\n"
